# Integrated-Upstream-Metagenomic-Analysis-Pipeline-within-a-Snakemake-Workflow
## Project Overview
This project integrates two comprehensive workflows for metagenomic analysis:

- Read-Length-Based Metagenomic Analysis\
- Assembly-Based Metagenomic Analysis

## Key Components
Reference Database Configuration

Setup and manage reference databases essential for accurate metagenomic profiling.
Upstream Data Analysis

Perform initial data processing and analysis to prepare for downstream applications.
## Final Output
The pipeline culminates in the generation of matrix files that are ready for direct downstream visualization, facilitating seamless data interpretation and further analysis.
